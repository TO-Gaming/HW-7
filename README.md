## Details:
how we made this game:
* as a base we used the scenes and scripts written by erelsegalhalevi.
* we changed the TilemapCaveGenerator script to support more tiles.
* we created 3 different levels with a increasing map size, and a portal to move between them.
* we added enemies with increasing difficulty in each level
* we added an option to mine mountins and chop the trees in the update func - 
holding space key for 3 seconds ente a scope that replaces the mount/tree tile to grass tile that you can walk on.
